It will be recommend to installing Anaconda, which comes with all of the necessary packages, as well as IPython notebook.
<br>
Why this Project?<br>
In this project, we have to go through the data analysis process and see how everything fits together. I have also use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib, which make writing data analysis code in Python a lot easier!
